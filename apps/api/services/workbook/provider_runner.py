"""Killable, process-isolated provider execution — the core of the scalable
enrichment engine (Track B).

THE PROBLEM this solves: a workbook provider can make a blocking call that
ignores its own timeout — a dead SMTP host, an un-timeout'd socket, a wedged
scraper. On a *thread* that is unrecoverable: Python cannot kill a thread, so the
thread leaks and, run after run, exhausts any pool until the whole enrichment
wedges (we proved this six ways — every in-process isolation just moved the
freeze point).

A *process* can be killed. We run each provider call in a pebble ProcessPool with
a hard per-call timeout. On timeout pebble SIGKILLs the worker and respawns a
fresh one, so a hung provider costs exactly one cell — never the run. This is the
unit that lets enrichment actually scale.
