"""MCP tool catalog + execution, RLS-scoped.

Every tool runs against the workspace-scoped, RLS-protected store
(``get_lead_store(workspace_id, slug)``) inside ``workspace_scope`` — never a
bare ``LeadDB()`` on the shared global file. This is the fix for the current
cross-tenant hole (a tool call could read every tenant's leads). The dispatch
here is the trusted server-side half; ``apps/mcp/server.py`` is now a thin
transport that authenticates, resolves an :class:`MCPCtx`, filters the catalog
to the token's capabilities, and delegates here.

Phase 2 adds the first WRITE tools — ``create_lead``, ``update_lead``,
``enroll_leads`` and a real ``create_workbook`` — each guarded by SIX
independent gates before it touches data:

  1. the per-token capability grant (``leads:write`` / ``sequences:enroll`` /
     ``workbooks:write``), filtered out of ``tools/list`` when absent;
  2. the global ``MCP_WRITE_ENABLED`` flag (default OFF) — two off-switches;
  3. a LIVE ``require_role`` re-check against the user's CURRENT workspace role
     (a downgrade to viewer denies the write even with a valid token);
  4. a per-workspace daily write cap + idempotency reservation (``mcp.caps``,
     reusing the automations ledger) so retries don't double-apply and writes
     can't exceed the tenant budget;
  5. the SAME RLS-scoped stores as the REST API inside ``workspace_scope`` so a
     token bound to workspace A can never write to B (args naming B are ignored —
     the workspace comes from the authenticated token, never the call);
  6. exactly one ``mcp_audit_log`` row per write attempt INCLUDING denials
     (capability/role/cap/error), the forensic trail for the confused-deputy case.

v2 adds higher-blast-radius write tools, each its own capability and all still
behind BOTH off-switches (``MCP_WRITE_ENABLED`` + the per-token grant):

  * ``create_automation`` (``automations:write``) — routes through the SAME
    validation as the REST automations create (``_validate_rule``): trigger /
    action / condition checks, the ``AUTOMATIONS_ALLOW_LEGACY_OUTREACH`` 409 for
    outreach actions, the ``AUTOMATIONS_ENABLED`` gate. ADMIN-only (mirrors the
    REST ``require_admin``).
  * ``send_email`` (``outreach:send`` — HIGHEST RISK) — enqueues through the
    EXISTING outreach send path (``actions._act_send_email`` → the durable
    ``send`` job → ``sending.handle_send``) so it inherits per-workspace
    suppression, debit-on-success, the hourly/daily rate limits and the bounce
    circuit breaker. NO parallel send. Refused (audited) when
    ``AUTOMATIONS_ALLOW_LEGACY_OUTREACH`` is off. ADMIN-only.
  * ``delete_lead`` (``leads:delete``) / ``delete_workbook`` (``workbooks:delete``)
    — DESTRUCTIVE hard-deletes matching REST semantics, ADMIN-only, tenant-safe
    (a cross-tenant id is a no-op miss under RLS), idempotent, audited.

Still NOT exposed: bulk ops, sequence start/pause (REST/admin-UI only).
