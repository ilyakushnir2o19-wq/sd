"""
JobSpy Hiring Signals Provider.

From speedyapply/JobSpy (10K+ stars).
Detects hiring signals from job boards — companies actively hiring
are more likely to be buying tools, expanding teams, and responsive
to sales outreach.

Hiring signals are a high-value enrichment: companies posting 5+ jobs
are in "rapid growth" mode, which correlates strongly with purchase intent.
