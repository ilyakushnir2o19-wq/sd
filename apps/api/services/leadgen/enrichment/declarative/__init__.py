"""
Declarative provider system — add an enrichment provider as a YAML manifest
instead of a bespoke Python client.

Ported from Othmane-Khadri/YALC-the-GTM-operating-system
(src/lib/providers/declarative + capabilities). See
docs/research/clay-alternatives-ingestion-catalog.md §G / Phase 1.5.

A manifest (auth / endpoint / request.bodyTemplate / response.mappings /
pagination) is compiled into a DeclarativeProvider(EnrichmentProvider) that
plugs into the existing waterfall + provider registry. Manifests live in
`manifests/<capability>/<provider>.yaml`.
