"""Standalone job worker — horizontally scalable.

This is the production job processor for the durable SQL job queue (the `jobs`
table driven by ``apps.api.services.queue_service.QueueService``). It is the
SAME queue the in-API background worker uses; the difference is that this runs
as its own process so you can scale it to N replicas behind one Postgres.

Concurrency and safety
------------------
Every replica claims work via ``queue_service.claim_next_job()``, which is
atomic and dialect-aware:

  * Postgres → ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED LIMIT 1`` then flip to
    ``processing`` in the same transaction. Two replicas never grab the same
    job (so no double-charge), and a row another replica is claiming is skipped
    rather than blocked on.
  * SQLite (dev/tests) → a guarded conditional ``UPDATE`` whose ``rowcount``
    confirms the claim.

Each replica runs ``WORKER_CONCURRENCY`` bounded claim slots (default 1, maximum
64), and each slot owns at most one killable subprocess. This file is safe to
run as ``replicas: N`` in docker-compose / k8s; total concurrency is replicas x
slots. Shutdown stops new claims, drains active slots for
``WORKER_SHUTDOWN_GRACE_SECONDS``, then cancels remaining subprocesses safely.
Postgres claimers also take a transaction-scoped advisory lock per workspace
before rechecking ``WORKER_MAX_ACTIVE_PER_WORKSPACE``. Concurrent replicas can
never race different rows past the configured tenant cap.

Run
---
    python -m apps.api.worker

Docker:
    command: python -m apps.api.worker

Relationship to the in-API worker
---------------------------------
When you run these standalone replicas, set ``RUN_INLINE_WORKER=0`` on the API
so it stops processing jobs itself (it still ENQUEUES them). In single-process
dev the API keeps its inline worker (default) and you don't need this process at
all.
