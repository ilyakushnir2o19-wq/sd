"""
Analytics Router — Dashboard metrics and trend data.

Aggregates data from leads, jobs, job_stages, and llm_usage tables
to power the analytics dashboard.

Backend note: the lead metrics work on either store. The jobs/llm-usage trends
live in the legacy per-file SQLite schema (they are NOT part of the shared,
RLS-protected Postgres `leads`/`signals` tables). When the active store is the
Postgres lead store (no raw `.conn`), the lead metrics are served from the
tenant-scoped store and the file-only jobs/llm sections degrade to empty —
migrating those trends onto the ORM is tracked as follow-up.
