An `output` column pushes each row to a destination after enrichment. It is
side-effecting, so it runs once per row and is idempotent by default; clear
the cell to re-push.

```json
{ "type": "output", "config": { "destination": "<kind>", "destination_config": { … } } }
```

## Destinations

| `destination` | `destination_config` | Credential |
|---|---|---|
| `webhook` | `url` (templated with `{Column}`), `method` (default `POST`), `headers`, `body` (template; JSON when it parses, otherwise raw text; defaults to the full row as JSON) | none |
| `crm` | `crm_type`: `hubspot` or `salesforce`; `field_map`: `{lead_field: crm_property}` | `HUBSPOT_TOKEN`, or `SALESFORCE_INSTANCE_URL` + `SALESFORCE_ACCESS_TOKEN` |
| `sheets` | `spreadsheet_id`, `range` (default `Sheet1`), `columns` (default company, email, phone, website, city) | `GOOGLE_SHEETS_TOKEN` |
| `airtable` | `base_id`, `table`, `field_map` (default Company, Email, Phone, Website, City) | `AIRTABLE_TOKEN` |
| `sequencer` | `sequence_id` of an OpenGTM outreach sequence | none |
| `instantly` | `campaign_id`, `field_map` | `INSTANTLY_API_KEY` |
| `smartlead` | `campaign_id`, `field_map` | `SMARTLEAD_API_KEY` |

Credentials resolve per workspace from **Settings → Integrations**, falling
back to `.env`.

CRM pushes send only the mapped fields and upsert by external id; a new
record is a HubSpot contact or a Salesforce lead. Sequencer pushes enrol the
row's email into the sequence and skip suppressed addresses. The cold-email
destinations default to a `{email, first_name, last_name, company_name}` map.

Audience destinations can also accept idempotent HubSpot or Salesforce
callbacks. Admins rotate a destination-bound bearer token from the Audiences
screen; only its hash is stored. Tokens expire after 90 days by default
(`OPENGTM_DESTINATION_TOKEN_TTL_DAYS`, clamped to 1–365 days), can be revoked,
and expose prefix, expiry, and last-use telemetry without revealing plaintext.
Tokens created before lifecycle enforcement must be rotated before reuse.

## Webhook safety

Webhook URLs must be `http` or `https` without embedded credentials, and the
host is resolved and rejected if it points at loopback, private, link-local
or metadata ranges (including `169.254.169.254`). The check is repeated at
send time so a hostname cannot flip to a private address after validation.

## Automations do the same thing

The `push_crm` and `webhook` automation actions reuse this code path, so a
row can be pushed when a signal fires rather than only at the end of a run.
See [Automations](/guides/automations/).
