A `source` column turns an ideal-customer-profile (ICP) description into rows.

## The registry

The registry holds about 90 discovery sources, each with a region
(`global`, `india`, `us`, `eu`), a category, query templates and a priority.
Categories: `directory`, `startup`, `saas_directory`, `review`, `social`,
`news`, `jobs`, `government`, `freelance`, `developer`, `ecommerce`.
Representative ids: `indiamart`, `justdial`, `tradeindia`, `ambitionbox`,
`naukri`, `zaubacorp`, `clutch`, `g2`, `crunchbase`, `angellist`,
`linkedin_companies`, `indeed`, `yelp`, `thomasnet`, `capterra`,
`producthunt`, `github_orgs`, `hackernews`, `trustpilot`, `upwork`,
`europages`, `kompass`.

The summary (totals by region and category) is available from the settings
API and shown in **Settings → Sources**.

## Source column config

```json
{
  "icp": {
    "description": "IT services companies in Pune, 20-200 employees",
    "industry": "IT services",
    "geo": "Pune",
    "keywords_any": ["staffing", "consulting"],
    "exclude": ["freelancer"]
  },
  "channels": {
    "categories": ["directory", "review"],
    "regions": ["india"],
    "explicit_sources": ["clutch", "justdial"]
  },
  "target_rows": 50
}
```

The free-text `description` wins when present; otherwise the query is built
from industry, keywords and geo. `target_rows` of 0 means unlimited.

Two nested kinds reroute the column:

- `source.kind: crm_import` pulls from a connected CRM (gated by
  `CRM_IMPORT_ENABLED`).
- `source.kind: people_search` sources people instead of companies (gated by
  `PEOPLE_SEARCH_SOURCE_ENABLED`).

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/workbooks/{id}/sources` | Add a source column |
| `POST /api/workbooks/{id}/sources/{column_id}/run` | Start a durable run (20/min) |
| `GET /api/workbooks/{id}/sources/{column_id}/preview` | Preview without writing rows |

## Durable connector runs

A run pages through sources, normalises records, and commits each page with its
cursor. Rows carry a stable provider + record identity so replays are
idempotent, and only one active run per workbook/connector pair is allowed.
The run record distinguishes requested, fetched, added, updated, skipped,
target-met, exhausted and failed, so "100 requested" is never reported as done
after 50 arrived.

## Other ways in

- **CSV import** with schema-aware column mapping
  (`POST /api/workbooks/{id}/import`).

### Migrating a Clay export

Drop a Clay CSV into the workbook importer. OpenGTM detects Clay filenames and
common metadata headers, maps standard company/person fields, and preserves
every computed or research result as an editable custom column. The mapping UI
warns when multiple source columns collapse into one target.

Automation clients can inspect the exact migration without writing data via
`POST /api/workbooks/{id}/import/preview`. Its report includes the detected
source, importable row count, standard/custom/skipped columns, target collisions,
and final mapping. The committed import stores that report with the workbook's
last-import metadata for later auditing. This supports Clay CSV exports; direct
Clay API ingestion is not claimed.
- **Ingest API** for pushes from scripts, the Chrome extension or n8n. See
  [Ingest API](/guides/ingest-api/).
- **Chat**: "find 50 D2C brands on Shopify in Bangalore" creates the source
  workbook for you after confirmation.

## Reliability and health (opt-in)

- `SOURCE_RELIABILITY_RANKING=1` lets learned yield swing a source's priority
  by up to ±4 points after 5 samples.
- `SOURCE_HEALTH_ENABLED=1` probes sources on a schedule and marks them
  degraded after 3 failures, disabled after 6, recovered after 2 successes;
  `SOURCE_HEALTH_ENFORCE=1` actually skips disabled sources.

All fetches go through the SSRF guard and, where enabled, a proxy list or
proxy manager (`PROXY_LIST`, `PROXY_MANAGER_URL`).
