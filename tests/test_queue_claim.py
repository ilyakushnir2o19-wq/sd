"""Concurrency-safety tests for QueueService.claim_next_job().

These run OFFLINE on SQLite (the conftest default DATABASE_URL). The Postgres
FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED path cannot be exercised here (no live Postgres), so we
verify the dialect detection picks the SQLite path and that the SQLite path
itself is double-grab-safe under real thread contention.

Core property under test: enqueue N jobs, run several claimers concurrently, and
assert each job is claimed by EXACTLY ONE claimer — never twice. That is the
horizontal-scaling guarantee (no double-grab → no double-charge).
