"""Workbooks — Postgres RLS + cross-tenant isolation tests (PG-gated). Spec §9.

GATED on TEST_DATABASE_URL (an owner PG URL). SKIPs when unset so the default
SQLite suite stays green. The owner role (user4) is a superuser and therefore
BYPASSES RLS — it is used only to run migrations + seed data. All isolation
assertions go through ``app_engine``, a NON-super, NON-BYPASSRLS login role
(``app_rls_test``) granted ``yupcha_app``, so the policies are exercised for real.

Proves acceptance criteria 1-4 + 12 of
docs/specs/followup-workbooks-rls-hardening-spec.md for every tenant-owned
workbook table, including durable connector runs.

Run:
    TEST_DATABASE_URL='postgresql+psycopg://user4@localhost:5432/<throwaway>' \
    PYTHONPATH=. uv run --group dev --with 'psycopg[binary]' \
    python -m pytest tests/test_workbooks_rls.py -q
