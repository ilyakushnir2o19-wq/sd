"""Workbook WORKER under FORCE RLS — the cutover proof (PG-gated). Spec §9.

The job runner has no request context: it learns its tenant from the job PAYLOAD
(OD-4) and enters ``workspace_scope`` before any query. These tests run the real
worker handlers against a NON-super, NON-BYPASSRLS connection (``app_rls_test``
granted ``yupcha_app``) with the production ``after_begin`` GUC hook installed, so
FORCE RLS is genuinely enforced. They prove:

  * handle_source_workbook materializes rows scoped to the PAYLOAD workspace, and
    those rows are visible ONLY under that tenant (criterion 6);
  * a job for tenant W2 cannot touch tenant W1's workbook (RLS hides it);
  * a job missing workspace_id fails loud (never an unscoped/global run);
  * the enrichment write path stamps + isolates workspace_id (criterion 6);
  * handle_signal_scan enumerates workspaces and runs each tenant's trigger pass
    under its own scope, writing per-tenant activity that obeys WITH CHECK
    (criterion 7).
