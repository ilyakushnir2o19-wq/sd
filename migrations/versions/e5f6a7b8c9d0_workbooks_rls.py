"""workbooks: RLS-harden workbooks + child tables (denormalized workspace_id)

Revision ID: e5f6a7b8c9d0
Revises: d4e5f6a7b8c9
Create Date: 2026-06-26 12:00:00.000000

PR-B of the workbooks RLS-hardening (docs/specs/followup-workbooks-rls-hardening-
spec.md). PR-A already tenant-scoped every worker/request path while RLS was
still OFF; this revision flips on the same proven RLS posture as
leads/signals/outreach (c42d0273d9bd / b2c3d4e5f6a7):

  * the four child tables (workbook_rows, workbook_enrichments, workbook_activity,
    cell_traces) carry NO tenant column today — add a denormalized
    ``workspace_id``, backfilled from the parent workbook;
  * ``workbooks.workspace_id`` was nullable (legacy NULL rows) — backfill then
    tighten to NOT NULL;
  * NULL handling (OD-1a) = backfill-then-block: legacy NULL-workspace workbooks
    are attributed to the single workspace / the ``main`` workspace; if the data
    is ambiguous (multiple workspaces, no ``main``) the migration ABORTS rather
    than guess a tenant (a wrong guess is a cross-tenant leak);
  * Postgres-only: least-privilege GRANTs to the app role + ENABLE/FORCE ROW
    LEVEL SECURITY + a fail-closed USING/WITH CHECK policy on
    ``current_setting('app.workspace_id', true)`` for all five tables.

SQLite/self-host gets the columns + backfill + NOT NULL + indexes only (RLS DDL
is dialect-guarded). The order is critical: the backfill runs while the tables
are still policy-free, BEFORE ENABLE/FORCE (FORCE binds the policy to the owner
too, which would otherwise block the owner's own backfill writes).
